Create a webpage that fetches data from the
"https://www.reddit.com/r/popular.json" link using the Fetch
 API with async/await syntax. Display the results on the webpage
  using HTML and CSS, such that each post's title, author, and image
   (if available) are shown in separate elements. Use JavaScript to manipulate 
   the DOM and insert the fetched data into the appropriate HTML elements.

Additionally, implement a search bar on the webpage that allows users to
search for posts containing specific keywords. When the user enters a search
term and submits the form, use JavaScript to filter the displayed posts to
show only those that match the search criteria.
