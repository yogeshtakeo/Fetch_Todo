Create a simple To-Do list application that allows users to add and remove items from a list.
 Use React and the useState hook to manage the list state.

The application should have an input field where users can enter a task and a button to add the task to the list.
 The list should be displayed below the input field and should show each task as a separate item. Each task should have a button to remove it from the list.

Additionally, add a counter to the application that displays the number of tasks currently on the list.

Use CSS to style the application, making sure that it is easy to use and visually appealing.
