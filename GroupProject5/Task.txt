Create a simple shopping cart application using React and the useState hook.
The application should have a list of products with their images, names, and prices. Each product should have a button that adds it to the shopping cart.

The shopping cart should be displayed in a separate section of the application, and should show each item that has been added to the cart, along with its name, image, price, and quantity.
Each item in the cart should have buttons to increase or decrease its quantity or remove it from the cart entirely.

Additionally, add a counter to the application that displays the total number of items in the shopping cart and a total cost counter that displays the sum of the prices of all the items in the cart.

Use CSS to style the application, making sure that it is easy to use and visually appealing.np
